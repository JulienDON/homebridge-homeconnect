# homebridge-homeconnect

Home Connect home appliances plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

[Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com), [Bosch](https://www.bosch-home.com/), [Siemens](https://www.siemens-home.bsh-group.com/), [Gaggenau](https://www.gaggenau.com/), [NEFF](https://www.neff-home.com/), and [Thermador](https://www.thermador.com/) are trademarks of [BSH Home Appliances](https://www.bsh-group.com).

## Installation

1. Connect your home appliances with Home Connect:
   1. Install Home Connect from the Apple App Store for your country (e.g. [UK](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/home-connect-app/id901397789) or [USA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-connect-america/id1134525430)).
   1. Create an account using your email address, click on the validation link in the email that will be received, and then return to the app and login.
   1. Connect the appliances to your home network, either via the app or using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS).
   1. Connect the appliances to the app (by following the installation guide provided with the appliance).
1. Obtain a Home Connect application *Client ID*:
   1. Sign-up for a free [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/user/register) account and login.
   1. [Register a new application](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications/add), ensuring that the *OAuth Flow* is set to *Device Flow*, and the *Home Connect User Account* is the same as the email address that was used within the Home Connect app.
   1. Save the displayed *Client ID* to include in the Homebridge `config.json` file.
1. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-homeconnect`
1. Edit `config.json` and add the HomeConnect platform (see example below).
1. Run [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
1. The Homebridge log output will include an authorization URL.
1. Copy the listed URL into a web browser and login to your Home Connect account.
1. Once the authorization has been completed the Homebridge log output will show: `Home Connect authorization successful!`
 
### Example `config.json`
```JSON
{
    "platforms":
    [{
        "platform":     "HomeConnect",
        "clientid":     "0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF"
    }]
}
```
The `clientid` should be set to the *Client ID* obtained from the [Home Connect Developer Program](https://developer.home-connect.com/applications) for the created *Device Flow* application.

To use [simulated appliances](https://developer.home-connect.com/simulator/) set `clientid` to the  *Client ID* for the automatically provided API Web Client and set `"simulator": true`.

## Notes

This plugin was developed and tested with a Siemens oven (HB678GBS6B/58), induction hob (EX677LYV1E/06), and dishwasher (SN678D06TG/53). It should work with all other Home Connect appliances, but functionality is currently more limited for other appliance types.

### Capabilities

### HomeKit Services and Characteristics

*HomeKit* does not define services and characteristics for home appliances, so the following are used: 

| Service                        | Characteristic              | Used for               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Switch`                       | `On`                        | Power on/off           |
| `Stateless Programmable Switch`| `Programmable Switch Event` | Events                 |
| `Home Appliance` *(custom)*    | `Current Door State`        | Door open/closed       |
| `Home Appliance` *(custom)*    | `Remaining Duration`        | Program progress       |
| `Home Appliance` *(custom)*    | `Active`                    | Operation state active |
| `Home Appliance` *(custom)*    | `Status Active`             | Operation state active |
| `Home Appliance` *(custom)*    | `Status Fault`              | Operation state error  |

For events, a `Single Press` is generated when the event occurs and is present, and a `Double Press` after it has been confirmed by the user.

Unfortunately, Apple's Home app (as of iOS 13) does not support custom services, and only shows numeric labels for `StatelessProgrammableSwitch` services. For full functionality use one of the following apps:
* Elgato's [Eve](https://www.elgato.com/en/eve/eve-app) *(free and recommended)*.
* Matthias Hochgatterer's [Home](http://hochgatterer.me/home/)

### No Control of Ovens, Hobs, or Fridge-Freezers

The [Home Connect Developer Agreement](https://developer.home-connect.com/developer_agreement) says (in section 7):
> Certain additional permissions to those specified at: https://developer.home-connect.com/docs/authorization/scope may be granted to Clients of selected Users upon an individual check by HC and upon agreement of a separate partner agreement between the Parties, which is based on this Agreement.

This is required for the `Hob-Control`, `Oven-Control`, and `FridgeFreezer-Images` scopes. Additionally, the appliance simulator disallows `CookProcessor-Control` and `FridgeFreezer-Control`. These scopes are therefore not supported by this plugin. Control of these appliances is therefore limited to just power on/off.

Use IFTTT Webhooks (e.g. via [homebridge-ifttt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-ifttt)) to control these appliances.
